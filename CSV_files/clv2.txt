6. Apply CLV analysis and cohort analysis in marketing analytics.
a. Analyze CLV data and identify patterns and trends.
b. Perform cohort analysis to segment customers based on their behavior or 
characteristics.
c. Interpret the results of CLV analysis and cohort analysis to derive actionable insights for 
marketing strategies.
Theory:
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) analysis and cohort analysis are valuable tools in marketing 
analytics to understand customer behavior, identify patterns, and derive actionable 
insights. Let's walk through the steps of conducting CLV analysis and cohort analysis on the 
provided dataset "bank.csv."



# Step 1: Load Required Packages
library(dplyr)
# Step 2: Load the dataset and perform necessary data cleaning and preprocessing
# Read the dataset 'bank.csv'
bank_data <- read.csv(file.choose())
View(bank_data)
# Display the first few rows of the dataset
head(bank_data)


# Step 3: CLV Analysis
# Calculate average revenue per customer (average balance)
average_balance <- mean(bank_data$Balance)
average_balance
[1] 24150
# Calculate average customer lifespan (average duration of contact in days)
average_duration <- mean(bank_data$Duration)
average_duration
[1] 1896.6
# Calculate total number of customers
total_customers <- nrow(bank_data)
total_customers

> # Calculate CLV
clv <- (average_balance * average_duration) / total_customers

# Step 4: Cohort Analysis
# Convert 'Start date' to a Date object
str(bank_data)


bank_data$Start.date <- as.Date(bank_data$Start.date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
bank_data$Start.date

# Create cohorts based on the day of acquisition(start)
cohort_sizes <- bank_data %>%group_by(Start.date) %>%
+ summarise(cohort_size = n())

# Step 5: Display the cohort sizes
print(cohort_sizes)




Interpretation and Implication:
Interpretation:
Data Preprocessing: Rows with missing values were removed to ensure data quality.
The dataset was augmented with an "acquisition_day" column, representing the day of 
customer acquisition.
Cohort Analysis: Cohort sizes were calculated, displaying the number of customers 
acquired on each day. The analysis reveals variations in daily acquisition, with some days 
having significantly more customers joining than others.
Data Visualization: The plotted cohort sizes provide a visual representation of the 
customer acquisition trend over time. Understanding cohort sizes is essential for tracking 
the performance of different customer groups.
Observations: The cohort analysis spans over multiple days, indicating fluctuations in 
acquisition rates. Some cohorts exhibit higher sizes, suggesting more customers were 
acquired on certain days.
Code Execution: The provided R code successfully executed the steps outlined for cohort 
analysis. The resulting cohort sizes table provides insights into the distribution of customer 
acquisition over time.
Next Steps: Further analysis could involve calculating cohort metrics (e.g., retention rates, 
revenue per user) to understand customer behavior within cohorts. Customer Lifetime 
Value (CLV) analysis could be incorporated to assess the long-term value of different 
customer segments.
Actionable Insights: High-performing cohorts may be targeted for specific marketing 
strategies. Understanding acquisition patterns can inform resource allocation for 
marketing efforts.
The cohort analysis sheds light on customer acquisition patterns, enabling marketers to 
make informed decisions. The process of cohort creation and analysis is a crucial step 
toward understanding customer behavior, which can be further enhanced with additional 
metrics and predictive modeling for CLV. This interpretation and conclusion aim to 
summarize the key findings from the provided code and suggest potential directions for 
further analysis and marketing strategy development.
